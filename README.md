# pairednetworkbootstrap
R code for implementing paired network inference for test of equality and test of scaling for a wide variety of random graph models. Includes methods proposed in the paper the paper "A Bootstrap-based Inference Framework for Testing Similarity of Paired Networks" by Somnath Bhadra, Kaustav Chakraborty, Srijan Sengupta, and Soumendra Lahiri. Please see (and cite) the arXiv version of the paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06869 to use the codes. Codes also include tests proposed in two previous papers, as described in the readme.
